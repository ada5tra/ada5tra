## Hi there ðŸ‘¾

Hi there! Iâ€™m Cats ðŸ˜º, a 29 y.o. data engineer with a super strong passion for growing my skills in *data engineering* and *cloud solutions*! ðŸŒ¸ I absolutely love diving into personal analytics, finding fresh insights, and exploring the magical world of how generative AI can help revolutionise healthcare! ðŸ§ âœ¨

Iâ€™m always curious and excited to learn about the latest *science* and *tech* developments! Outside of work, I have so much fun researching my favourite topics and writing articles and books, which I self-publish as a fun hobby! [Here's what I have on **Amazon** so far](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22catarina+girofl%C3%A1%22&rh=n%3A283155&dc&ds=v1%3AexmTOCn24JmBnhFqjEGN6auIcIOcY%2BDTE4z7Tpfehk4&crid=D9KATYXCKH4F&qid=1736452213&rnid=2941120011&sprefix=catarina+girofl%C3%A1+%2Caps%2C188&ref=sr_nr_n_1). ðŸ“šðŸ’–

I also have a wide range of knowledge in areas like digital marketing, cybersecurity, genomics, psychology, neuroscience, and theology.
